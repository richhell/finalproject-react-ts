# Final Project for Promineo Tech's Front End Software Developer Bootcamp

This is a very simple bookstare application. Users can view a list of books
that are currently available and that can be pre-ordered. Users can add
books to their cart and remove them.

This project uses React, Bootstrap, and mockapi.

## Update (2025-02-23): 
I added a pubDate value to the book objects so that each list can be sorted
properly.
