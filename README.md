# Final Project for Promineo Tech's Front End Software Developer Bootcamp

This project is a very basic bookstore. A user can add books to their cart from the front page list of currently available books and from the Upcoming Releases page. They can view their cart, and remove books from their cart. 

This project uses React, TypScript, Bootstrap, and mockapi.

## Update (2025-02-23):
I add a pubDate value for the book objects. When rendering the lists of available and upcoming releases, I compare the pubDates to the current date. This way, users can add and remove upcoming releases from their cart.
